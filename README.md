## Description of my solution

* I have built the solution using React Functional components and hooks.
* For specifying props and state types I have built the code in Typescript.
* I have integrate Pull-to-Refresh on the news feed page to get latest updates on news.
* I have structured the application into main page and other reusable components ( card, error and loader) by using React principle such as every component serves a single functionality and DRY principle.
* I have used es6+ features like spread operators, async/await and arrow functions at suitable places.
* I have placed the assets needed for the application into `fonts` and `images` folders.
